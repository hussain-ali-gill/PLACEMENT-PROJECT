Placement Prediction using Machine Learning (with Dummy Data)
Project Description
This project focuses on predicting whether a student will be placed in a company based on academic, technical, and personal attributes. The dataset used is a dummy (synthetic) dataset named 'modified_placement_data.csv', created to mimic real-world placement records. It includes features like CGPA, communication skills, coding ability, internships, and more.

The goal is to demonstrate the machine learning workflow from data processing to model evaluation and prediction, using tools like Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
Project Steps Explained
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
- Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
- Converted categorical data into numerical format using encoding techniques.
- Normalized or scaled numerical values if needed to prepare for modeling.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualized the distribution of variables like CGPA, internship count, or technical skills.
- Identified patterns or correlations between features and the placement outcome.
- Used charts like histograms, box plots, heatmaps, and bar graphs to gain insights.
3. Feature Engineering and Selection:
- Selected the most relevant features based on EDA and correlation scores.
- Removed redundant or irrelevant columns.
- Optionally created new features by combining existing ones (e.g., average skill score).
4. Model Training:
- Split the dataset into training and test sets.
- Applied classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest.
- Trained the models on the training data.
5. Model Evaluation:
- Predicted outcomes on the test set and compared with actual values.
- Evaluation was performed using accuracy_score from the sklearn.metrics module.
- Example:
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix.
6. Interpretation & Insights:
- Analyzed which features most influence placement.
- Interpreted model outputs to understand how predictions are made.
- Suggested improvements or areas for future work (e.g., using real data, hyperparameter tuning).
Tools & Libraries Used
- Python: for scripting and model development
- Pandas & NumPy: for data handling
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: for data visualization
- Scikit-learn: for ML models and evaluation
